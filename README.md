# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which can lead to unexpected crashes or errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling. 

## Bug

The `bug.js` file demonstrates an Express.js route that retrieves a user based on their ID. However, if the provided ID is not a valid integer (e.g., a string, a negative number), the code attempts to parse it, potentially causing an error and crashing the application.  Furthermore, it doesn't handle the case where the user ID doesn't exist.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the improved code. It explicitly checks if `req.params.id` can be parsed as an integer. If it cannot, or if no user with that ID exists, it returns an appropriate HTTP error response (400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found), preventing application crashes and providing informative feedback to the client.  This ensures the app gracefully handles invalid or missing user IDs.
